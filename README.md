# CISC642 PR2
Repo: https://github.com/CarltonTB/Stereo_Analysis  
Author: Carlton Brady  
python version: 3.6.3  
dependencies:  
-opencv  
-numpy  


The images used are in the "sample_images" folder.    

HTML results pages that can be found in the "results" folder. They display the results nicely
when open in a browser:  
result1.html  
result2.html  
result3.html  
result4.html  
result5.html  
result6.html  

an interactive demo can be launched with the following command:  
python3 demo.py  

Note: multi-resolution with 3 levels takes ~20 minutes on my machine, and 1 level takes ~10 minutes  

The "feature_based" and "region_based" folders contain various other results images, 
but the html pages have the best results with explanations and parameters listed.
